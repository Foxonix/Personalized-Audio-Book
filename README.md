Program description  
This program steps forward and backward through the audio of a book.
When the forward button is pressed, the audio for the next page in the book will
be played. When the back button is press, the previous page will be played.
The buttons are interruptible, so if audio is playing and a button is
pressed then the current file will stop playing and the new file will
start.
